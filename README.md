# Design and Verification using UVM for I2C
I2C (pronounced "I-squared-C" or "I-two-C") stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit. It is a serial communication protocol used to allow multiple devices (usually low-speed peripherals) to communicate with a microcontroller or processor using just two wires:

ðŸ”Œ I2C Lines:
- 1- SCL (Serial Clock Line): Carries the clock signal, generated by the master.

- 2- SDA (Serial Data Line): Carries the data between devices.

## 1. Directories:
- rtl               : rtl design.
- tb/top            : hvl top.
- tb/test           : tests.
- tb/env            : Environment, scoreboard ...
- tb/agents         : agents.
- tb/sequences      : sequences.

## 3. Interface signals:
| Signal name   | Direction | Signal width      | Description                      
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------                                        
| clk	        | input	    | 1-bit	            | System clock signal. Drives the internal FSM and timing of I2C operations.
| rst	        | input	    | 1-bit	            | Reset signal. Resets internal registers and control logic.
| wr	        | input	    | 1-bit	            | Write enable. When 1, initiates a write operation; when 0, could imply a read operation (depending on your design).
| addr	        | input	    | 7-bit	            | I2C slave address. Specifies which I2C device to communicate with.
| din	        | input	    | 8-bit	            | Data to be transmitted to the I2C slave in a write operation.
| datard	    | output	| 8-bit	            | Data received from the slave in a read operation.
| done	        | output reg| 1-bit	            | Indicates that the I2C operation has completed (either read or write). Can be used to trigger the next step in a larger FSM.
